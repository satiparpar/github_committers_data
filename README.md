Want to access every possible data from an organization on github, including repos, committers info, dates, and more ?!
You got this!
You just need to give this code the organization name and then you will receive an Excel file with all data you wanted.
For example in my case I needed the name and the email of the committers who had any contribution after 2023 for an specific organization with commit messages.
Hint: Before running the code, on your base JSON file insert an empty array like this : [] .
